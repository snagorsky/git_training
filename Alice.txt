Hi! I'm Alice. I'm a file someone added to this repository a while ago.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Now Sydney is editing it
changing alice.txt on change_alice branch

=======
And here is a second line some guy put in. Then he added more to make a merge conflict.
And here's even more text for the rebasing exercise. Along with a new change to demonstrate (and subsequentially ruin) fetch!
